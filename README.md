# ZERO WASTE KITCHEN ASSISTANT 
A smart, interactive system designed to help households reduce food waste by tracking pantry items, predicting expiry, analyzing weather impact, suggesting recipes based on available ingredients, and rewarding users for sustainable food habits.


## About
The Zero Waste Kitchen Assistant is a web-based system developed to address the growing issue of domestic food waste.
Traditional pantry management is manual, time-consuming, and often leads to forgotten or spoiled ingredients. This project aims to solve these challenges by creating a digital, AI-assisted kitchen companion.

Users can:
Add pantry items with expiry dates
Receive weather-based food safety alerts
Get ingredient-based recipe suggestions
Earn reward points for using expiring ingredients
View cooking instructions interactively
Receive smart notifications through a service worker
The system integrates AI logic, APIs, authentication, and a digital reward mechanism to improve efficiency and promote sustainable cooking habits.


## Features
Smart pantry tracking with expiry reminders.
Weather-based food spoilage alerts.
Ingredient-based recipe suggestions.
Reward points for sustainable cooking.
Lightweight, fast, and scalable web application.


## Requirements
Operating System: Works on any modern OS (Windows 10+, macOS, or Linux) with a compatible web browser.
Development Environment: A browser-based environment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the interface and logic.
API Services: OpenWeather API for retrieving real-time weather data and a Recipe API / dataset for generating recipe suggestions.
Authentication Framework: Clerk Authentication for user login, session management, and secure access control.
Version Control: Git and GitHub for collaborative development, version tracking, and project maintenance.
IDE: Visual Studio Code recommended for coding, debugging, and integrating extensions like Live Server.
Additional Dependencies: TailwindCSS (CDN), Service Worker support for notifications, and optional Firebase/Local Storage for pantry data persistence.
